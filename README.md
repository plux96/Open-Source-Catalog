# Open-Source-Catalog Changed by Umid Rustamov

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nasa/Open-Source-Catalog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nasa/Open-Source-Catalog)

## About

This GitHub repository is maintained by the [NASA OCIO Open Innovation Team](http://open.nasa.gov/about/) and contains a catalog of publicly available NASA open source projects that are published on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov). The catalog is persisted as a JSON file ```catalog.json``` and contains an array of projects.  As Code Sharing at NASA is a community effort, we encourage NASA developers to add a meta-record in to this catalog to publish their open source projects on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/).

## Requirements
* Open Source software project approved for open source release by your [NASA Field Center SRA](http://code.nasa.gov/#/guide)
* Code Project hosted in a code repository (preferably GitHub.com) and visible to Internet Users
* Meta record of your software project; instantiate ```required_fields_project_template.json```

## Add/Edit your project
### OPTION 1
If you are behind the NASA firewall, we recommend you use the online form located [here](https://developer.nasa.gov/pages/OpenInnovation/code-submission-app/)

We recommend option 1.

### OPTION 2
Create a project meta-record using the template from file required_fields_project_template.json:
  * Note that Category labels longer than 24 characters will be truncated.

* Add your instantiated meta-record to the array in the catalog.json file via a pull request
* Once the merge is complete, your project will be published on [code.nasa.gov](http://code.nasa.gov/)
